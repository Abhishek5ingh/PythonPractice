# Coin Flip Simulation
# Create a program that uses Pythonâ€™s random number generator to simulate flipping
# a coin several times. The simulated coin should be fair, meaning that the probability
# of heads is equal to the probability of tails. Your program should flip simulated
# coins until either 3 consecutive heads of 3 consecutive tails occur. Display an H each
# time the outcome is heads, and a T each time the outcome is tails, with all of the
# outcomes shown on the same line. Then display the number of flips needed to reach
# 3 consecutive flips with the same outcome. When your program is run it should
# perform the simulation 10 times and report the average number of flips needed.
